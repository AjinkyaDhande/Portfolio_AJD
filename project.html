            <h2>Hubbii Framework</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:1.2em;">It’s a framework that was being designed to save initial website setup time. It is similar to HTML5 Boiler Plate framework. It has some popular frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Pure CSS, UIKit, Reset CSS, Modernizr, JQuery build in for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web using good stuff from all the framework.</p>

            <h2>Simple E- Commerce Application</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:1.2em;">It is a simple E-Commerce Application which has search capabilities based on categories, a product listing page, login system, a shopping cart, checkout system and messaging system to the admin. This whole web application was developed mainly using HTML5 and CSS3 for the front end, PHP as server side scripting language and MySQL as the database.</p>

            <h2>3D CAD Model</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:1.2em;">I being hobbyist developed few 3D Models using software like CATIA V5, V6 & Keyshot</p>

            <h2>Study and Analysis of Effects of Multiple Cracks on Vibration Behavior of Cantilever Beam</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:1.2em;">Cracks in vibrating component that can initiate catastrophic failures. The presences of cracks change the physical characteristics of a structure which in turn alter its dynamic response characteristics. Therefore there is need to understand dynamics of cracked structures. Crack depth and location are the main parameters for the vibration analysis. So it becomes very important to monitor the changes in the response parameters of the structure to access structural integrity, performance and safety. To examine the effect of the crack to the natural frequency of beams.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:1.2em;">In the present study, vibration analysis is carried out on a cantilever beam with two open transverse cracks, to study the response characteristics. In first phase transverse cracks of different depth and at different length were made and then analyzed on the test rig using FFT Analyzer. The cracks of increasing strength will be observed by monitoring by natural frequency and which is measured by FFT analyzer. The results obtained by above experiment are validated with the results obtained from the simulation. The simulations have done with the help of ANSYS software. Suitable boundary conditions were used to find out natural frequency and mode shapes.</p><br><br>

            <h2>Seminar Presented : Formula One Technology</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:1.2em;">The purpose of this seminar was to show how the advanced technology of the world’s fastest and largest spectator-sport can be used in the normal superhighways and expressways setting standards of safety for the general public who drive on the highways. Use of barriers similar to those used in formula one can reduce the amount of injury in case of accidents on these highways. Even the use of CSAS (Circuit and Safety Analysis System) can be used to build safer highways.</p><br><br>
